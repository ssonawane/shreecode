    "question": "What is the difference between Element and Component ?",
    "answer": "An Element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. Elements can contain other Elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated."

    "question": "What is state in React ?",
